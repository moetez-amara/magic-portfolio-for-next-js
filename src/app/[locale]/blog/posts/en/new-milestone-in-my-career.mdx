Every career has defining moments that push us to grow, adapt, and challenge our assumptions. One of the most pivotal points in my career came when I made the bold decision to take a year-long break from my engineering studies to dive headfirst into the family business. That choice not only shaped my professional life but also transformed me as a person and a leader.

##The Leap from Engineering to Leadership
Taking time off from engineering school was not an easy decision, but the opportunity to contribute to my family's solar installation business was one I couldn't pass up. During that year, I went from being a student to becoming the leader of a solar installation team—an experience that was as intense as it was rewarding.

In my role as a team leader, I was responsible for managing a group of technicians, overseeing installations, and ensuring that we met client expectations. We worked on projects that totaled over 100 kW of solar power, and our work spanned more than 30 clients, ranging from residential homes to commercial properties. Each installation presented its own challenges, but we successfully delivered clean energy solutions, driving the adoption of renewable power in our community.

##Growth as a Leader and a Person
This leadership role was a steep learning curve. Not only did I have to manage the technical aspects of solar installation, but I also had to navigate the complexities of team dynamics, client relations, and project management. Leading a team of skilled professionals gave me a new perspective on responsibility, accountability, and the importance of clear communication.

The pressure to perform, meet deadlines, and ensure the satisfaction of our clients forced me to develop problem-solving skills on the fly. I learned that leadership is about setting a vision but also about being adaptable and staying calm under pressure. Every project taught me something new, whether it was about negotiation, logistics, or managing unexpected technical challenges.

##An Opportunity for Personal Growth
This time away from the classroom was invaluable. It allowed me to grow in ways that traditional education couldn't offer. I was no longer just a student learning theory—I was applying what I had learned to real-world challenges, making decisions that had tangible impacts. It was a year that shaped my leadership style, gave me confidence in my abilities, and reinforced my passion for sustainable energy.

I returned to engineering school with a renewed sense of purpose and a wealth of practical experience. The lessons I learned during that year continue to influence my approach to problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership. It was more than just a break from school—it was a transformative period that helped me grow both personally and professionally.

##Looking Forward
This milestone is not the end but rather a significant chapter in my career journey. The experiences and lessons I gained have prepared me for future challenges, whether in engineering, project management, or leadership roles. I’m excited to continue pushing boundaries and contributing to the sustainable energy sector, armed with the skills and insights gained from this unforgettable experience.
